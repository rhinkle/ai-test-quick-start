# AI Test Quickstart

This is a test to see how well differnt AI models can generate a application based on the a quickstart readme file.

## Why is this important to you?

Sometimes the most annoying thing when you have an idea is getting started. I know what I like in my enviroments and I know what I want to use. But getting started is a pain.


## Why not make a base project and just copy it?

Well, things get out of date, and versions change as times go on. Also have you ever started up an old project and found that half the stuff is deprecated or no longer works?
